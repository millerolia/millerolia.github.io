                My name is Olha Tamtura. I come from Vinnytsia, a city in the central part of Ukraine, which stands on
                the shores of Pivdennyi Buh river. Being surrounded with Ukrainian literature, folklore and music since
                the very first day of my life, my rapidly developing passion for poetry was just a question of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beginning with learning tiny pieces of silly poems to perform in the family circle as a child and ending
                with reciting English translations of famous Ukrainian authors for a volunteer project - poetry has
                always played a crucial role in my life. It shaped character, imprinted my worldview, and formed my
                personality as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote my first poem at the age of 18, and it has made me feel things I never thought I was capable of.
                I have been occasionally producing small pieces of poetry since then, so my portfolio is constantly
                developing. Today, I am 20, and I feel like there are too many things to feel and experience in this
                world, so I eagerly await capturing these memories into my Thoughts Twister.
            </p>

                September, 2022. One of the happiest moments of my life, for sure.
